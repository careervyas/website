      "Either option can give you a solid foundation in engineering principles as well as prepare you for a successful career in the engineering field. Diploma programs typically have a more practical focus and non-medical is more theoretical. After Diploma you can opt for B.Tech. B. tech is a 3 years for diploma holders otherwise it is a 4 year course for normal non-medical schooling. But in case you want to go to an IIT or NIT you need to go through a non-medical process. There is no provision in IITs or NITs for Diploma holders.",
